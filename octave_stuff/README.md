# Matlab and Octave Stuff
- My Laptop can't afford matlab so i work with octave
- This repo will contain ??matlab code?? and neccessary files maybe required for it.
- I am really bad at it but a good electrical enginner doesn't code in C, HE/SHE codes in matlab which contains some 10 layer of abstraction, but its cool, you get graph without dealing with raylib or sdl so it's okay

- GOOD BYE
